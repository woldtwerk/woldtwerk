# Willi Woldt

Hey, I am Willi. My passion is everything js, css and html related.

I'm especially fond of Vue and custom elements. I also like Drupal a lot. It's an amazing CMS and you can build performant frontend with it.

I like to build things that work automagically. That's why I created a vite plugin for building drupal themes. It's inspired by all the magic we get spoiled with by amazing frameworks like Nuxt.

Also I'm addicted to good lighthouse scores. Images are a big in good scores. That's why I build a custom element for drupal. It delivers the best image using mostly the browser to do the work.

Apart from programming I like flying with the paramotor and biking.
