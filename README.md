Hey, I am Willi. My passion is everything js, css and html related.

I'm especially fond of Vue and custom elements. I also like Drupal a lot. It's an amazing CMS and you can build performant frontend with it.

I like to build things that work automagically. That's why I created a vite plugin for building drupal themes. It's inspired by all the magic we get spoiled with by amazing frameworks like Nuxt.

Also I'm addicted to good lighthouse scores. Correct handling of images has huge influence in good scores. That's why I build a custom element for drupal. It delivers the best image by letting the browser handle the work.

Apart from programming I like flying with the paramotor and biking.
